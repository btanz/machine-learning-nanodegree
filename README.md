# Completed Projects for Udacity ML Engineer Nanodegree
This repository consists of four projects completed for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. A short outline of the projects is provided below.

## 1. Boston Housing Prices
The goal of this project is to accurately predict house prices in the Boston area. A decision tree regressor is trained to achieve this task.

## 2. Building a Student Intervention System (Supervised Learning)
Goal of this project is to identify an efficient machine learning algorithm to identify students that may benefit from early intervention in order to pass a test. Algorithms and models such as logistic regression, support vector classifier and random forrest classifiers are applied. Given the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy, logistic regression is recommended for this problem.

## 3. Creating Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)
Goal of this project is to analyze and segment customers of a wholesale distributor. Various techniques, such as PCA, ICA and k-means clustering are applied to accurately cluster customers.

## 4. Training a Smartcab how to drive (Reinforcement Learning)
Goal of this project is to devise and algorithm that allows an agent that moves on a grid with obstacles (Smartcab) to learn how to reach a destination on the grid, avoiding obstacles on the way. Q-learning is applied to implement agent learning and learning parameters are tuned such that the agent learns very quickly.
